Client program:
import socket

s = socket.socket()
host = '111.111.0.11' # needs to be in quote
port = 1247
s.connect((host, port))
print s.recv(1024)
inpt = raw_input('type anything and click enter... ')
s.send(inpt)
print "the message has been sent"

server program:
import socket

s = socket.socket()
host = socket.gethostname()
port = 1247
s.bind((host,port))
s.listen(5)
while True:
    c, addr = s.accept()
    print("Connection accepted from " + repr(addr[1]))

    c.send("Server approved connection\n")
    print repr(addr[1]) + ": " + c.recv(1026)
    c.close()

Both programs need to be run on different CPU's, with server starting first
