Goal: increase temperature
Explain planet situation:
    If far from sun:
        This planet is farther from the sun than Earth, so it receives a baseline of less heat. To compensate, we need to amplify the sun's heat, increasing temperature by increasing the greenhouse effect and decreasing the albedo effect.
    If close to sun:
        This planet is closer to the sun than Earth, so it receives a baseline of more heat. However, a combination of low greenhouse effect and high albedo mean it still has too low of a temperature, and we need to compensate by bringing these under control.
Manipulate GHG effect:
    If pressure > 0.5:
        GHGs (greenhouse gases) help retain the sun's heat with the greenhouse effect. To increase the temperature, we can increase the amount of GHGs in the atmosphere. However, humans cannot breathe with more than 2% GHG, so we may eventually need to decrease GHGs to breathable levels. If necessary, more oxygen and inert gases can be introduced to decrease the % GHG while still maintaining the greenhouse effect, making the atmosphere more breathable at the expense of higher pressure.
    else:
        GHGs (greenhouse gases) help retain the sun's heat with the greenhouse effect. To increase the temperature, we can increase the amount of GHGs in the atmosphere. Additionally, the greenhouse effect is weaker in thin atmospheres, so adding oxygen or inert gases would also be helpful.
Manipulate water vapor effect:
    Water vapor also acts as a greenhouse gas, helping retain the sun's heat with the greenhouse effect. Water vapor is more common with higher water and temperature levels - thus, increasing temperature can increase water vapor, further increasing temperature. However, introducing water can increase albedo through ice and clouds, reflecting more light and decreasing temperature. These opposing properties mean adding or removing water can be unpredictable - it is best to modify water in small amounts to test its effects on temperature.
Manipulate albedo effect:
    Albedo is anything decreasing the light absorbed by the planet, decreasing temperature. This is primarily caused by a thick atmosphere, toxic gases, clouds, and bright terrain colors. We can decrease albedo to absorb more light by removing toxic gases and thinning the atmosphere. Additionally, removing water can increase temperature by decreasing the albedo caused by ice and clouds, although this can also decrease the water vapor effect. Again, changes to water can be unpredictably change temperature, and are best done in small amounts to find their effects.
