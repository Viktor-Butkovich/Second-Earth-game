Second Earth - a game simulating human colonization of another world

Welcome to Second Earth!

Note: While the world coordinate system used in this game is effective for simulating local terrain patterns and movement across a planet, it is in no way entirely accurate. The distortions caused by this coordinate system result in some areas being adjacent to ones that should be across the planet, as well as make it impossible to accurately project the map onto a sphere. This game strives to be a scientifically accurate simulation of humanity's future, but we had some serious discussions and decided to have a compromise between accuracy, playability, and development effort in this particular area.
